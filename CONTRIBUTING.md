Thank you for your interest in contributing to Scratchpad! This guide will help you get started with contributing to the VSCode extension, web application, and overall project.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+ installed
- Git installed and configured
- VS Code installed (for extension development)
- GitHub account (for contributions)

### Project Structure

```
scratch/
├── apps/
│   ├── extension/          # VSCode extension
│   ├── mobile/            # React Native mobile app
│   └── web/               # Next.js web application
├── packages/              # Shared packages (if any)
└── docs/                  # Documentation
```

### Development Setup

1. **Fork the repository**
   ```bash
   # Fork on GitHub, then clone your fork
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/scratch.git
   cd scratch
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   # Install root dependencies
   npm install
   
   # Install app-specific dependencies
   cd apps/extension && npm install
   cd ../web && npm install
   cd ../mobile && npm install
   ```

3. **Set up development environment**
   ```bash
   # For extension development
   cd apps/extension
   npm run watch
   
   # For web development
   cd apps/web
   npm run dev
   
   # For mobile development
   cd apps/mobile

   ```

## 📝 Development Guidelines

### Code Style

We use ESLint and Prettier for code formatting. Configuration files are included in each app.

```bash
# Lint code
npm run lint

# Fix formatting
npm run format

# Type check
npm run type-check
```

### Commit Messages

Follow conventional commit format:
